# Analyse Rice Quality Using Deep Learning
The proportion of foreign grains in a rice grain's purity is one of the most important factors to consider. The majority of rice traders used to use manual annotations done by labourers with years of experience to check the purity of rice grain. However, this procedure is costly and, in most cases, produces incorrect results. This, too, takes a long time. So the aim of this project is to determine the purity of a Rice sample in a matter of seconds and with high precision using a scanned image of the sample.
The end result would identify each grain and classify it according to its grain type.

## Training and Dataset Preparation
You can use the ```Rice_Grain_Analysis.ipynb``` notebook to train the model from scratch. All the codes are documented well. You can also run the code in Google ```Colab``` after uploading the Dataset in Google Drive and mounting the drive. To do this you need to run the following code snippet.
